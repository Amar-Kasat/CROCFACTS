            "Crocodiles have been around for over 200 million years, making them one of the oldest living reptiles, surviving the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs.",
            "Crocodiles have one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom. Their bite force can exceed 3,700 pounds per square inch (psi), which is stronger than that of a great white shark.",
            "Crocodiles are excellent hunters. They often lie in wait, partially submerged in water, and use their powerful tails to propel themselves towards prey with incredible speed.",
            "The sex of a crocodile is determined by the temperature of the nest during incubation. Warmer temperatures tend to produce males, while cooler temperatures produce females.",
            "Crocodiles can swim at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour (32 kilometers per hour) by using their tails to propel themselves through the water.",
            "Crocodiles can live for a long time, with some species living up to 70 years or more in the wild.",
            "Unlike many reptiles, crocodiles are quite vocal. They communicate with each other through a variety of sounds, including growls, hisses, and bellows.",
            "Crocodiles have a four-chambered heart, similar to birds and mammals, which allows them to efficiently oxygenate their blood and stay submerged underwater for extended periods.",
            "Female crocodiles are known for their maternal instincts. They guard their nests and help their hatchlings reach the water after they emerge from their eggs.",
            "While they primarily eat fish and mammals, crocodiles are opportunistic feeders and will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, reptiles, and even other crocodiles."
